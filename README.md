#Huffman Tree in Processing!

Just some spagetti code for a Huffman Tree, feel free to optimize and add fiddle around if you're interested. This is done in Processing which is a really cool Java framework for visual representation of data or just visuals.

Just make sure that you place a txt file in the /data folder with the name Cartilla.txt to make a Huffman tree out of it, or just modify the code for it to pop up a file selector or something, might add that later on.
